# Morse-Translator

Ever thought of a way to communicate with only Dots **( . )**  and Dashes **( _ )**  <br>
No need to think when you can use this Morse translator

### Wanna Try it :)

Well since we're using python better install it :P <br/>
If you're on **Windows** check this out: <br/>

If you're on **Linux/UNIX** check this out: <br/>

If you're on **MacOS** check this out: <br/>

### After Python Install

Open Powershell / CMD prompt (Terminal)
check Python version: 

```
python -V
```
check PIP version:
```
pip -V
```

### install Git 

Git is a version control tool. 
It will be needed to run the project

visit here to install git:
```
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

after install go to the directory where you would run the project:
```
mkdir morse-translator
cd .\morse-translator
```

clone the project:
```
https://github.com/Hasanriz14/Morse-Translator.git
```

it's better to use a virtual environment than to clutter the main install

Use:
```
python -m venv venv
```

Once that's done 
Do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
command:
```
python .\main.py
```

There is one more feature I will be adding later in future to complete this short script 
If you face any problems/ issues do create an issue on this github page.
Would be a massive help
